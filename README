This ansible playbook is prepared for Dark site Centos7 installations and includes all required binaries to install and configure a Quobyte cluster that can immediately be used to write data to.
Quobyte clients can be installed using the same playbook.

Terminology:

Management Node
- A computer (can be a seperate node or the first node in the cluster) with ansible installed
- Has root access to all nodes and clients that should be part of the cluster by name
- Has passwordless key access to all cluster and client nodes
- The host key for all cluster and client nodes has been accepted (by connecting to each node once)

Cluster Node
- Has CentOS >= 7 up and running
- A server that fulfills the minimal requirements to become a quobyte node
- Has a root account configured used to manage it via ansible

Client Node
- Has CentOS >= 7 up and running
- A server that fulfills the minimal requirements to become a quobyte client
- Has a root account configured used to manage it via ansible

Preparation:

1) Edit the inventory file
 a) In section [cluster] put all Cluster Nodes by name (one per line)
 b) In section [bootstrap] put one Cluster Node by name
 c) In section [nodes] put all Cluster Nodes except the one you selected to be the bootstrap node 
 d) In section [diskformat] put in all Cluster Nodes if you want the playbook to automaticly create a default volume (batteries included) (requires mddisksize)
 d) In section [clients] put all Client Nodes by name (one per line) (Cluster nodes already have the client installed)
3) Edit vars/quobyte.yaml
   Set the variables to a meaningful value for your environment
     registry: The DNS A record for service discovery (example: registry.quobyte.local)
     mddisksize: The size of the flash device used for metadata on each node 64 (output size from lsblk) (only required when using [diskformat])
     mountpoint: Mountpoint name for the Quobyte client (example: /quobyte)
5) Start the installation
 a) Within the quobyte-rpm-ansible directory run the following command on the Management Node

   ansible-playbook -b -i inventory quobyte.yaml
