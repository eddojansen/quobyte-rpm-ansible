This ansible playbook is designed for Centos 7 based Quobyte installations on Dark sites. The inventory folder includes empty subfolders for all required binaries to install and configure a Quobyte cluster that can immediately be used to write data to (batteries included).

The empty folders need to be populated with the required packages:
(Current) Chrony package
(Current) Java and dependencies packages (use yum install -y --downloadonly java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless)
(Current) Quobyte server packages (from private repository)
(Current) Quobyte client packages (from private repository)

The Quobyte client will be installed on the storage nodes, additional clients can be installed using the same playbook by populating the client nodes in the [clients] section of the inventory file.

Terminology:

Bootstrap
- Has CentOS >= 7 up and running
- The first node in the cluster with ansible installed
- Has root access to all nodes and clients that should be part of the cluster by name
- Has passwordless key access to all cluster and client nodes
- The host key for all cluster and client nodes has been accepted (by connecting to each node once)

Cluster Node
- Has CentOS >= 7 up and running
- A server that fulfills the minimal requirements to become a quobyte node
- Has a root account configured used to manage it via ansible

Client Node
- Has CentOS >= 7 up and running
- A server that fulfills the minimal requirements to become a quobyte client
- Has a root account configured used to manage it via ansible

Preparation:

1) Edit the inventory file
 a) In section [cluster] put all Cluster Nodes by name (one per line)
 b) In section [bootstrap] put one Cluster Node by name
 c) In section [nodes] put all Cluster Nodes except the one you selected to be the bootstrap node 
 d) In section [diskformat] put in all Cluster Nodes if you want the playbook to automaticly create a default volume (batteries included) (requires mddisksize)
 d) In section [clients] put all Client Nodes by name (one per line) (Cluster nodes already have the client installed)
3) Edit vars/quobyte.yaml
   Set the variables to a meaningful value for your environment
     registry: The DNS A record for service discovery (example: registry.quobyte.local)
     mddisksize: The size of the flash device used for metadata on each node 64 (output size from lsblk) (only required when using [diskformat])
     mountpoint: Mountpoint name for the Quobyte client (example: /quobyte)
5) Start the installation
 a) Within the quobyte-rpm-ansible directory run the following command on the Bootstrap Node

   ansible-playbook -b -i inventory quobyte.yaml
